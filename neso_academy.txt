## CIA TRIAD

# DEFINE COMPUTER SECURITY
- THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO AN AUTOMATED INFORMATION SYSTEM
- IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THE APPLICABLE OBJECTIVES OF
- PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY, AVAILABILITY, AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF
- INFORMATION SYSTEM RESOURCES (INCLUDES HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, INFORMATIN AND TELECOMUNNICATIONS)

# KEY OBJECTIVES OF COMPUTER SECURITY
- INTEGRITY, AVAILABILITY, CONFIDENTIALITY

# CIA TRIAD
- CONFIDENTIALITY: WE NEED PROTECT THE DATA THAT BEING TRANSMITTED
- INTEGRITY: DATA SENT EQUAL TO DATA RECEIVED (NO MODIFICATION WHILE DATA IS BEING TRANSMITTED)
- AVAILABILITY: WE NEED TO ENSURE THE TIMELY AND RELIABLE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM 

- ADDITIONAL ELEMENT OF CIA TRIAD:
- AUTHENTICITY
- ACCOUNTABILITY

# VARIOUS LEVEL OF IMPACT OF SECURITY BREACH
- LOW: LIMITED ADVERSE EFFECT ON ORGANIZATION
- MEDIUM
- HIGH



## OSI SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

# THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THREAT AND ATTACK
- ATTACK = IF SOMEONE IS SUCCESSFUL IN BREAKING YOUR SECURITY SYSTEM AND ENTER YOUR HOME AND STEAL YOUR BELONGINGS
- THREAT = IF THERE ARE POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF SECURITY IN YOUR SYSTEM

- A THREAT IS A POSSIBLE DANGER THAT MIGHT EXPLOIT A VULNERABILITY
- AN ATTACK IS AN ASSAULT ON SYSTEM SECURITY THAT DERIVES FROM AN INTELLIGENT THREAT

# OSI SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
- DEALS WITH THREE THINGS:
  - SECURITY ATTACK
  - SECURITY MECHANISM
  - SECURITY SERVICE

- SECURITY ATTACK: ACTION THAT COMPROMISE THE SECURITY
- SECURITY MECHANISM: DETECT, PREVENT, OR RECOVER FROM A SECURITY ATTACK
- SECURITY SERVICES: ENHANCES THE SECURITY, COUNTER SECURITY ATTACKS AND PROVIDE THE SERVICE



## SECURITY ATTACKS
- VARIOUS PASSIVE ATTACKS
- PASSIVE ATTACK: ATTEMPTS TO LEARN OR MAKE USE OF INFORMATION FROM THE SYSTEM
- PASSIVELY UNAUTHORIZED READING OF MESSAGES
- READING MESSAGES SEND BY TRANSMITTER BEFORE ARRIVED AT RECEIVER

- PASSIVE ATTACK 
- DOES NOT AFFECT SYSTEM RESOURCES
- MAIN INTENTION IS TO EAVESDROPING OR MONITORING TRANSMISSION
- GOAL: OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT IS BEING TRANSMITTED

- 2 TYPES OF PASSIVE ATTACKS
  - RELEASE OF MESSAGE CONTENTS
  - TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

- RELEASE OF MESSAGE CONTENTS
  - WHEN ATTACKER GET THE COPY OF MESSAGE SEND FROM SENDER TO RECEIVER USING TELECOMMUNICATION MEDIUM
  

- TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
  - ATTACKER CAN NOT OPEN THE MESSAGE THAT SENT BY SENDER TO RECEIVER BECAUSE IT WAS ENCRYPTED
  - BUT ATTACKER CAN ANALYZE ANOTHER DATA LIKE SENDER AND RECEIVER LOCATION, TIME THE MESSAGE SENT, FREQUENCY, PATTERN
  

- ACTIVE ATTACK
- INVOLVE SOME MODIFICATION OF DATA STREAM OR THE CREATION OF A FALSE STREAM

- 4 TYPES OF ACTIVE ATTACKS
  - MASQUERADE
  - REPLAY
  - MODIFICATION OF MESSAGES
  - DENIAL OF SERVICES (DoS)


- MASQUERADE
- ATTACKER LOGIN TO SOMEONE ACCOUNT AND SEND MESSAGE TO SOMEBODY

- REPLAY
- MESSAGE FROM SENDER IS CAPTURED BY ATTACKER AND RETRANSMITTED TO RECEIVER
- MESSAGE SUBSEQUENTLY RETRANSMITTED

- MODIFICATION OF MESSAGE
- MESSAGE FROM SENDER IS CAPTURED BY ATTACKER, MODIFIED AND RETRANSMITTED TO RECEIVER

- DENIAL OF SERVICE (DoS)
- ATTACKER CREATE ACTION ON THE SERVER THAT MAKES USER CANNOT ACCESS THE SERVER
- ATTACKER OVERLOADING THE SERVER TO DEGRADE THE SERVER PERFORMANCE
- THE USER DENIED WHEN TRY TO ACCESS THE SERVER
- ATTACKER CREATE A LOT OF TCP CONNECTION REQUEST

- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PASSIVE AND ACTIVE ATTACKS
- PASSIVE ATTACK 
- DO NOT INVOLVE IN MODIFICATION OF MESSAGES
- HARD TO DETECT
- SOLUTION: ENCRYPT THE MESSAGES

- ACTIVE ATTACK 
- LEAD TO MODIFICATION OF MESSAGES
- HARD TO PREVENT
- SOLUTION: DETECT AND RECOVER FROM ANY DISRUPTION OR DELAYS



# SECURITY SERVICES
- THE PROCESSING OR COMMUNICATION SERVICE THAT IS PROVIDED BY A SYSTEM
- TO GIVE A SPECIFIC KIND OF PROTECTION TO SYSTEM RESOURCES.

- SECURITY SERVICES IMPLEMENT SECURITY POLICIES AND ARE IMPLEMENTED BY SECURITY MECHANISMS.

- 5 PART OF SECURITY SERVICES

  - AUTHENTICATION: ASSURANCE THAT COMMUNICATING ENTITY IS THE ONE THAT IT CLAIM TO BE
    - RECEIVER MAKE SURE THAT THE MESSAGE WAS SENT BY ORIGINAL SENDER USING AUTHENTICATION
    - 2 TYPE OF AUTHENTICATION
      - PEER ENTITY AUTHENTICATION
      - DATA ORIGIN AUTHENTICATION

  - ACCESS CONTROL:
    - CONTROL THE ACCESS
    - EXAMPLE: EMPLOYEE CAN ACCESS DOCUMENT A, BUT MANAGER CAN ACCESS DOCUMENT A AND B
  
  - DATA CONFIDENTIALITY
    - ONLY THE ORIGINAL RECEIVER CAN OPEN AND READ THE MESSAGE SENT FROM THE ORIGINAL SENDER
    - DO THIS USING ENRYPTION

  - DATA INTEGRITY
    - MESSAGE SENT BY TRANSMITTER EQUAL TO MESSAGE RECEIVE BY RECEIVER

  - NONREPUDIATION
    - WE CAN CHECK THAT SENDER IS REALLY SENT THE MESSAGE
    - ALSO WE CAN CHECK THAT THE RECEIVER IS ALREADY GET THE MESSAGE



# SECURITY MECHANISMS
- VARIOUS SECURITY MECHANISMS
- WE NEED SECURITY SERVICES WHICH IMPLEMENT SECURITY POLICIES THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED BY SECURITY MECHANISM

- 2 TYPE OF SECURITY MECHANISM
  - SPECIFIC SECURITY MECHANISM
  - PERVASIVE SECURITY MECHANISM

- SPECIFIC SECURITY MECHANISM
- INCORPORATED INTO APPROPRIATE PROTOCOL LAYERS TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE OSI SECURITY SERVICES

- PART OF SPECIFIC SECURITY MECHANISM
  - ENCHIPERMENT: CHIPERING TECHNIQUE (CONVERT PLAIN TEXT INTO CIPHER TEXT BEFORE SENDING IT)
				HOW TO GENERATE CHIPER TEXT: USING MATH ALGORITHM
  - DIGITAL SIGNATURE: HAVING A SIGNATURE IN ORDER TO PROOF THE IDENTITY OF THE SENDER
    IN ORDER TO HAVE AUTHENTICATION WE NEED DIGITAL SIGNATURE
    ALSO WE CAN USE DIGITAL SIGNATURE TO PROVIDE DATA INTEGRATION
  - ACCESS CONTROL: 
  - DATA INTEGRITY: 
  - AUTHENTICATION EXCHANGE: THIS MECHANISM ENSURES THAT THE IDENTITY OF AN ENTITY BY MEANS OF AN INFORMATION EXCHANGE
    (A SMALL PIECE OF INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN ENTITIES JUST FOR AUTH PURPOSE)
  - TRAFFIC PADDING: DUMMY DATA STREAMS THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE NETWORK IN ORDER TO CONFUSE ATTACKER
  - ROUTING CONTROL: INFORMING THAT WHAT ROUTE THE DATA MUST TAKE IN ORDER TO REACH THE DESTINATION
  - NOTARIZATION: DEPLOY SOME TRUSTED THIRD PARTY; WHEN WE NEED TO ACCESS A SECURE SERVER WE HAVE SSL SERTIFICATE,
    THIS ISSUED BY CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY WHICH IS THE TRUSTED THIRD PARTY

- PERVASIVE SECURITY MECHANISM
- NOT INCORPORATED TO ANY PARTICULAR LAYER OR ANY PARTICULAR SERVICE

- PART OF PERVASIVE SECURITY MECHANISMS
  - TRUSTED FUNCTIONALITY: PERCEIVE TO BE CORRECT WITH RESPECT TO SOME CRITERIA, FOR EXAMPLE: SECURITY POLICIES
  - SECURITY LABEL: HAVE SOME LABEL TO ACHIEVE SECURITY, HELPS US TO IDENTIFY WHETHER WE ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING
  - EVENT DETECTION: EVENT IS WHENEVER ANY ACTIVITY IS CARRIED OUT IN THE SECURE SYSTEM;
    SO WE NEED TO DETECT ANY EVENT THAT HAPPEN.
  - SECURITY AUDIT TRAIL: DOING SECURITY AUDIT BASED ON THE DATA THAT COLLECTED; REVIEW SYSTEM RECORD & ACTIVITY 
  - SECURITY RECOVERY: FOCUS ON RECOVERY AFTER THE ATTACK OR DAMAGE DONE.



# NETWORK SECURITY MODEL
- MODEL FOR NETWORK SECURITY

         TRUSTED THIRD PARTY                    TRUSTED THIRD PARTY                             TRUSTED THIRD PARTY
           |                                             |                                                 |
(SENDER)MESSAGE -> SECRET INFO I -> SECURE MESSAGE -> INTERNET -> SECURE MESSAGE -> SECRET INFO II -> MESSAGE(RECEIVER)
                                                         |
                                                      ATTACKER
LEGEND:
SECRET INFO I: CONVERT MESSAGE INTO CIPHER TEXT WITH A KEY (ENCRYPTION)
SECRET INFO II: CONVERT CIPHER TEXT INTO PLAIN MESSAGE WITH A KEY (DECRYPTION)

- FOUR MAJOR TASK FOR CREATE MODEL FOR NETWORK SECURITY
  1. DESIGN AN ALGORITHM (THE REAL SECURITY LIES ON ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM)
  2. GENERATE THE SECRET INFORMATION OR KEY (ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM TAKE 2 IMPORTANT INPUT: PLAIN TEXT, KEY); 
  3. DEVELOP METHODS FOR DISTRIBUTION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION (HOW TO DISTRIBUTED KEY)
  4. SPECIFY A PROTOCOL ()

- NETWORK ACCESS SECURITY MODEL

ATTACKER -> ACCESS CHANNEL -> GATEKEEPER FUNCTION -> INFORMATION SYSTEM

LEGEND:
ATTACKER: HUMAN OR VIRUS
GATEKEEPER FUNCTION: FIREWALL, ANTIVIRUS
INFORMATION SYSTEM: COMPUTING RESOURCES, DATA, PROCESS, SOFTWARE 



# CRYPTOGRAPHY

PLAIN TEXT -> ENCRYPTION ALGO -> CIPHER TEXT -> TRANSMITTED -> CIPHER TEXT -> DECRYPTION ALGO -> PLAIN TEXT

- ENCRYPTION ALGO TAKE 2 IMPORTANT INPUT
  1. PLAIN TEXT
  2. KEY

  THE OUTPUT: CIPHER TEXT ET CETERA

- DECRYPTION ALGO TAKE 1 IMPORTANT INPUT
  1. KEY

  THE OUTPUT: PLAIN TEXT

- SYMETRIC CIPHER MODEL: WHEN SYSTEM USING THE SAME KEY FOR ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION ALGO

- CRYPTOGRAPHY IS THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING PLAIN TEXT TO CIPHER TEXT AND CONVERTING THE CIPHER TEXT BACK TO PLAIN TEXT
- FORMAL DEFINITION OF CRYPTOGRAPHY IS THE ART OR SCIENCE ENCOMPASSING THE PRINCIPLES AND METHODS
- OF TRANSFORMING AN INTELLIGIBLE MESSAGE INTO ONE THAT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE
- THEN RETRANSFORMING IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORM.

- TWO TYPES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY
- SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY (PRIVATE KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY): THE ENCRYPTION ALGO AND DECRYPTION ALGO USE THE SAME KEY;
  SENDER AND RECEIVER WILL BE SHARING THE SAME KEY
- ASIMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY (PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY): THE ENCRYPTION ALGO AND DECRYPTION ALGO THAT USE DIFFERENT KEY
  
- ENCRYPTION SCHEMES
- THE TWO QUALITIES ENCRYPTION SCHEMES SHOULD HAVE
  1. UNCONDITIONALLY SECURE
  2. COMPUTATIONALLY SECURE

- AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME ARE SAID TO BE UNCONDITIONALLY SECURE IF:
  IF THE CIPHER TEXT GENERATED BY ENCRYPTION SCHEME DOES NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DETERMINE 
  UNIQUELY THE CORRESPONDING PLAIN TEXT
  IT MEANS THE ATTACKER CANNOT READ THE ORIGINAL INFORMATION EASILY

- AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME ARE SAID TO BE UNCOMPUTATIONALLY SECURE IF:
  ATTACKER INVESTING A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO BREAKING THE CIPHER TEXT AND STILL NOT SUCCESSFULL
  OR IF THE COST ON BREAKING THE CIPHER IS EXCEDING THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION INSIDE CIPHER TEXT
  IF THE TIME TO BREAKING THE CIPHER IS EXCEDING THE USEFULL LIFETIME OF THE INFORMATION

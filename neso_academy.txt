## CIA TRIAD

# DEFINE COMPUTER SECURITY
- THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO AN AUTOMATED INFORMATION SYSTEM
- IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THE APPLICABLE OBJECTIVES OF
- PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY, AVAILABILITY, AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF
- INFORMATION SYSTEM RESOURCES (INCLUDES HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, FIRMWARE, INFORMATIN AND TELECOMUNNICATIONS)

# KEY OBJECTIVES OF COMPUTER SECURITY
- INTEGRITY, AVAILABILITY, CONFIDENTIALITY

# CIA TRIAD
- CONFIDENTIALITY: WE NEED PROTECT THE DATA THAT BEING TRANSMITTED
- INTEGRITY: DATA SENT EQUAL TO DATA RECEIVED (NO MODIFICATION WHILE DATA IS BEING TRANSMITTED)
- AVAILABILITY: WE NEED TO ENSURE THE TIMELY AND RELIABLE ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM 

- ADDITIONAL ELEMENT OF CIA TRIAD:
- AUTHENTICITY
- ACCOUNTABILITY

# VARIOUS LEVEL OF IMPACT OF SECURITY BREACH
- LOW: LIMITED ADVERSE EFFECT ON ORGANIZATION
- MEDIUM
- HIGH



## OSI SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

# THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THREAT AND ATTACK
- ATTACK = IF SOMEONE IS SUCCESSFUL IN BREAKING YOUR SECURITY SYSTEM AND ENTER YOUR HOME AND STEAL YOUR BELONGINGS
- THREAT = IF THERE ARE POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF SECURITY IN YOUR SYSTEM

- A THREAT IS A POSSIBLE DANGER THAT MIGHT EXPLOIT A VULNERABILITY
- AN ATTACK IS AN ASSAULT ON SYSTEM SECURITY THAT DERIVES FROM AN INTELLIGENT THREAT

# OSI SECURITY ARCHITECTURE
- DEALS WITH THREE THINGS:
  - SECURITY ATTACK
  - SECURITY MECHANISM
  - SECURITY SERVICE

- SECURITY ATTACK: ACTION THAT COMPROMISE THE SECURITY
- SECURITY MECHANISM: DETECT, PREVENT, OR RECOVER FROM A SECURITY ATTACK
- SECURITY SERVICES: ENHANCES THE SECURITY, COUNTER SECURITY ATTACKS AND PROVICE THE SERVICE



## SECURITY ATTACKS
- VARIOUS PASSIVE ATTACKS
- PASSIVE ATTACK: ATTEMPTS TO LEARN OR MAKE USE OF INFORMATION FROM THE SYSTEM
- PASSIVELY UNAUTHORIZED READING OF MESSAGES
- READING MESSAGES SEND BY TRANSMITTER BEFORE ARRIVED AT RECEIVER

- PASSIVE ATTACK 
- DOES NOT AFFECT SYSTEM RESOURCES
- MAIN INTENTION IS TO EAVESDROPING OR MONITORING TRANSMISSION
- GOAL: OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT IS BEING TRANSMITTED

- 2 TYPES OF PASSIVE ATTACKS
  - RELEASE OF MESSAGE CONTENTS
  - TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

- RELEASE OF MESSAGE CONTENTS
  - WHEN ATTACKER GET THE COPY OF MESSAGE SEND FROM SENDER TO RECEIVER USING TELECOMMUNICATION MEDIUM
  

- TRAFFIC ANALYSIS
  - ATTACKER CAN NOT OPEN THE MESSAGE THAT SENT BY SENDER TO RECEIVER BECAUSE IT WAS ENCRYPTED
  - BUT ATTACKER CAN ANALYZE ANOTHER DATA LIKE SENDER AND RECEIVER LOCATION, TIME THE MESSAGE SENT, FREQUENCY, PATTERN
  

- ACTIVE ATTACK
- INVOLVE SOME MODIFICATION OF DATA STREAM OR THE CREATION OF A FALSE STREAM

- 4 TYPES OF ACTIVE ATTACKS
  - MASQUERADE
  - REPLAY
  - MODIFICATION OF MESSAGES
  - DENIAL OF SERVICES (DoS


- MASQUERADE
- ATTACKER LOGIN TO SOMEONE ACCOUNT AND SEND MESSAGE TO SOMEBODY

- REPLAY
- MESSAGE FROM SENDER IS CAPTURED BY ATTACKER AND RETRANSMITTED TO RECEIVER
- MESSAGE SUBSEQUENTLY RETRANSMITTED

- MODIFICATION OF MESSAGE
- MESSAGE FROM SENDER IS CAPTURED BY ATTACKER, MODIFIED AND RETRANSMITTED TO RECEIVER

- DENIAL OF SERVICE (DoS)
- ATTACKER CREATE ACTION ON THE SERVER THAT MAKES USER CANNOT ACCESS THE SERVER
- ATTACKER OVERLOADING THE SERVER TO DEGRADE THE SERVER PERFORMANCE
- THE USER DENIED WHEN TRY TO ACCESS THE SERVER
- ATTACKER CREATE A LOT OF TCP CONNECTION REQUEST

- DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PASSIVE AND ACTIVE ATTACKS
- PASSIVE ATTACK 
- DO NOT INVOLVE IN MODIFICATION OF MESSAGES
- HARD TO DETECT
- SOLUTION: ENCRYPT THE MESSAGES

- ACTIVE ATTACK 
- LEAD TO MODIFICATION OF MESSAGES
- HARD TO PREVENT
- DETECT AND RECOVER FROM ANY DISRUPTION OR DELAYS


# SECURITY SERVICES
- THE PROCESSING OR COMMUNICATION SERVICE THAT IS PROVIDED BY A SYSTEM
- TO GIVE A SPECIFIC KIND OF PROTECTION TO SYSTEM RESOURCES.

- SECURITY SERVICES IMPLEMENT SECURITY POLICIES AND ARE IMPLEMENTED BY SECURITY MECHANISMS.

- 5 PART OF SECURITY SERVICES

  - AUTHENTICATION: ASSURANCE THAT COMMUNICATING ENTITY IS THE ONE THAT IT CLAIM TO BE
    - RECEIVER MAKE SURE THAT THE MESSAGE WAS SENT BY ORIGINAL SENDER USING AUTHENTICATION
    - 2 TYPE OF AUTHENTICATION
      - PEER ENTITY AUTHENTICATION
      - DATA ORIGIN AUTHENTICATION

  - ACCESS CONTROL:
    - CONTROL THE ACCESS
    - EXAMPLE: EMPLOYEE CAN ACCESS DOCUMENT A, BUT MANAGER CAN ACCESS DOCUMENT A AND B
  
  - DATA CONFIDENTIALITY
    - ONLY THE ORIGINAL RECEIVER CAN OPEN AND READ THE MESSAGE SENT FROM THE ORIGINAL SENDER
    - DO THIS USING ENRYPTION

  - DATA INTEGRITY
    - MESSAGE SENT BY TRANSMITTER EQUAL TO MESSAGE RECEIVE BY RECEIVER

  - NONREPUDIATION
    - WE CAN CHECK THAT SENDER IS REALLY SENT THE MESSAGE
    - ALSO WE CAN CHECK THAT THE RECEIVER IS ALREADY GET THE MESSAGE
